# pogo-tweets
This was the final project for a data science MOOC I did.

The course was the [edx.org course DSE200x, Python for Data Science.](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x) The assignment was to apply one of the machine learning approaches we had studied to do some new analysis. We had studied NLP and sentiment analysis as well as how to access Twitter. Around the time that I was considering what to do for my project, Niantic hosted the Pokemon Go Fest, which was [plagued with connectivity and other issues](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16019404/pokemon-go-fest-refunds-disaster-review) and was largely panned on Reddit. I decided to start saving tweets related to Pokemon Go over the course of that day and the following month to use in sentiment analysis. For consistency, I kept the same search parameters over the whole month, but when I started to analyze the search results, I identified several aspects of the search query that were suboptimal. In the end the sentiment analysis did not match the sentiment that I observed personally.

In this repository I have included my Jupyter notebook, in which I did the analysis, as well as a stack of slides describing the problem and my approach.
